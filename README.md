<h2>WIL/Thoughts ðŸ¤”</h2>

  <p>I am revisiting some JS concepts like closures and scopes, same with what I did with the 
    <a href="https://fatrixienicolieopetina.github.io/book-library/">book library app</a>.
    This is my first JS + UI exercise in Odin, to refresh my HS javascript.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think what took most of my time while doing this project is the css part. Primarily because I do not want to use a framework since I wanted to refresh and relearn css's styling basics.
